# Jumper
Tension so thick you can cut it with a knife! <i>Jumper</i> seems like a pretty 
laid back game until it's not! The rules are simple. The jumper guesses letters, 
one at a time. If the letter's not in the puzzle, the parachute loses a line. 
Guessing continues until the puzzle is solved or, well, you know.
